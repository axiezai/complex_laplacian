---
This repository includes the analysis as described in [ ], where we investigate whether we can recreate the canonical functional networks of the human brain from structural connectivity with a simple low dimensional and analytical solution. 

## Set up:
This repository is dependent on [`spectrome`](https://github.com/Raj-Lab-UCSF/spectrome), please see instructions in the repository for setting up your `conda` environment. Activating the `spectrome` environment will enable all the analysis in this repository.
