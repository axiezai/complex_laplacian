Structural connectivity matrix and distance adjacency matrix were extracted from diffusion tensor images, the values in the matrices were viewed as nodes and edges metrics in a network. We perform an eigen decomposition on the network's complex Laplacian to obtain structural eigenmodes of the brain, then we compare the spatial similarities between the structural eigenmodes and canonical functional networks.
