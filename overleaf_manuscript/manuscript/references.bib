abstract = {Information processing in the cerebral cortex involves interactions among distributed areas. Anatomical connectivity suggests that certain areas form local hierarchical relations such as within the visual system. Other connectivity patterns, particularly among association areas, suggest the presence of large-scale circuits without clear hierarchical relations. In this study the organization of networks in the human cerebrum was explored using resting-state functional connectivity MRI. Data from 1,000 subjects were registered using surface-based alignment. A clustering approach was employed to identify and replicate networks of functionally coupled regions across the cerebral cortex. The results revealed local networks confined to sensory and motor cortices as well as distributed networks of association regions. Within the sensory and motor cortices, functional connectivity followed topographic representations across adjacent areas. In association cortex, the connectivity patterns often showed abrupt transitions between network boundaries. Focused analyses were performed to better understand properties of network connectivity. A canonical sensory-motor pathway involving primary visual area, putative middle temporal area complex (MT+), lateral intraparietal area, and frontal eye field was analyzed to explore how interactions might arise within and between networks. Results showed that adjacent regions of the MT+ complex demonstrate differential connectivity consistent with a hierarchical pathway that spans networks. The functional connectivity of parietal and prefrontal association cortices was next explored. Distinct connectivity profiles of neighboring regions suggest they participate in distributed networks that, while showing evidence for interactions, are embedded within largely parallel, interdigitated circuits. We conclude by discussing the organization of these large-scale cerebral networks in relation to monkey anatomy and their potential evolutionary expansion in humans to support cognition.},

abstract = {A key characteristic of human brain activity is coherent, spatially distributed oscillations forming behaviour-dependent brain networks. However, a fundamental principle underlying these networks remains unknown. Here we report that functional networks of the human brain are predicted by harmonic patterns, ubiquitous throughout nature, steered by the anatomy of the human cerebral cortex, the human connectome. We introduce a new technique extending the Fourier basis to the human connectome. In this new frequency-specific representation of cortical activity, that we call ‘connectome harmonics', oscillatory networks of the human brain at rest match harmonic wave patterns of certain frequencies. We demonstrate a neural mechanism behind the self-organization of connectome harmonics with a continuous neural field model of excitatory–inhibitory interactions on the connectome. Remarkably, the critical relation between the neural field patterns and the delicate excitation–inhibition balance fits the neurophysiological changes observed during the loss and recovery of consciousness. Inter-areal oscillatory synchronization is constrained by anatomical connections, yet a fundamental principle linking functional and structural connectivity is lacking. Here, Atasoy and colleagues show that harmonic patterns in structural connectome can predict dynamics of resting state networks.},

abstract = {How structural connectivity (SC) gives rise to functional connectivity (FC) is not fully understood. Here we mathematically derive a simple relationship between SC measured from diffusion tensor imaging, and FC from resting state fMRI. We establish that SC and FC are related via (structural) Laplacian spectra, whereby FC and SC share eigenvectors and their eigenvalues are exponentially related. This gives, for the first time, a simple and analytical relationship between the graph spectra of structural and functional networks. Laplacian eigenvectors are shown to be good predictors of functional eigenvectors and networks based on independent component analysis of functional time series. A small number of Laplacian eigenmodes are shown to be sufficient to reconstruct FC matrices, serving as basis functions. This approach is fast, and requires no time-consuming simulations. It was tested on two empirical SC/FC datasets, and was found to significantly outperform generative model simulations of coupled neural masses.},

abstract = {The engineering of a 3. T human MRI scanner equipped with 300. mT/m gradients - the strongest gradients ever built for an in vivo human MRI scanner - was a major component of the NIH Blueprint Human Connectome Project (HCP). This effort was motivated by the HCP's goal of mapping, as completely as possible, the macroscopic structural connections of the in vivo healthy, adult human brain using diffusion tractography. Yet, the 300. mT/m gradient system is well suited to many additional types of diffusion measurements. Here, we present three initial applications of the 300. mT/m gradients that fall outside the immediate scope of the HCP. These include: 1) diffusion tractography to study the anatomy of consciousness and the mechanisms of brain recovery following traumatic coma; 2) q-space measurements of axon diameter distributions in the in vivo human brain and 3) postmortem diffusion tractography as an adjunct to standard histopathological analysis. We show that the improved sensitivity and diffusion-resolution provided by the gradients are rapidly enabling human applications of techniques that were previously possible only for in vitro and animal models on small-bore scanners, thereby creating novel opportunities to map the microstructure of the human brain in health and disease. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Connectivity analyses and computational modeling of human brain function from fMRI data frequently require the specification of regions of interests (ROIs). Several analyses have relied on atlases derived from anatomical or cyto-architectonic boundaries to specify these ROIs, yet the suitability of atlases for resting state functional connectivity studies has yet to be established. This paper introduces a data-driven method for generating an ROI atlas by parcellating whole brain resting-state fMRI data into spatially coherent regions of homogeneous functional connectivity. Several clustering statistics are used to compare methodological trade-offs as well as determine an adequate number of clusters. Additionally, we evaluate the suitability of the parcellation atlas against four ROI atlases (Talairach and Tournoux, Harvard-Oxford, Eickoff-Zilles, and Automatic Anatomical Labeling) and a random parcellation approach. The evaluated anatomical atlases exhibit poor ROI homogeneity and do not accurately reproduce functional connectivity patterns present at the voxel scale. In general, the proposed functional and random parcellations perform equivalently for most of the metrics evaluated. ROI size and hence the number of ROIs in a parcellation had the greatest impact on their suitability for functional connectivity analysis. With 200 or fewer ROIs, the resulting parcellations consist of ROIs with anatomic homology, and thus offer increased interpretability. Parcellation results containing higher numbers of ROIs (600 or 1000) most accurately represent functional connectivity patterns present at the voxel scale and are preferable when interpretability can be sacrificed for accuracy. The resulting atlases and clustering software have been made publicly available at: http://www.nitrc.org/projects/cluster\_roi/.},

	abstract = {Following severe injuries that result in disorders of consciousness, recovery can occur over many months or years post-injury. While post-injury synaptogenesis, axonal sprouting and functional reorganization are known to occur, the network-level processes underlying recovery are poorly understood. Here, we test a network-level functional rerouting hypothesis in recovery of patients with disorders of consciousness following severe brain injury. This hypothesis states that the brain recovers from injury by restoring normal functional connections via alternate structural pathways that circumvent impaired white matter connections. The so-called network diffusion model, which relates an individual's structural and functional connectomes by assuming that functional activation diffuses along structural pathways, is used here to capture this functional rerouting. We jointly examined functional and structural connectomes extracted from MRIs of 12 healthy and 16 brain-injured subjects. Connectome properties were quantified via graph theoretic measures and network diffusion model parameters. While a few graph metrics showed groupwise differences, they did not correlate with patients' level of consciousness as measured by the Coma Recovery Scale - Revised. There was, however, a strong and significant partial Pearson's correlation (accounting for age and years post-injury) between level of consciousness and network diffusion model propagation time (r = 0.76, p {\textless} 0.05, corrected), i.e. the time functional activation spends traversing the structural network. We concluded that functional rerouting via alternate (and less efficient) pathways leads to increases in network diffusion model propagation time. Simulations of injury and recovery in healthy connectomes confirmed these results. This work establishes the feasibility for using the network diffusion model to capture network-level mechanisms in recovery of consciousness after severe brain injury.},

Validating predictions from network control theory, we uncover the relationship between regional controllability and the focal versus global impact of stimulation, and we relate these findings to differences in the underlying network architecture. Finally, by mapping brain regions to cognitive systems, we observe that the default mode system imparts large global change despite being highly constrained by structural connectivity.

Our results suggest that densely connected areas, particularly in the default mode system, facilitate the movement of the brain to many easily reachable states. Weakly connected areas, particularly in cognitive control systems, facilitate the movement of the brain to difficult-to-reach states. Areas located on the boundary between network communities, particularly in attentional control systems, facilitate the integration or segregation of diverse cognitive systems.

	abstract = {The development of whole-brain models that can infer effective (directed) connection strengths from fMRI data represents a central challenge for computational neuroimaging. A recently introduced generative model of fMRI data, regression dynamic causal modeling (rDCM), moves towards this goal as it scales gracefully to very large networks. However, large-scale networks with thousands of connections are difficult to interpret; additionally, one typically lacks information (data points per free parameter) for precise estimation of all model parameters. This paper introduces sparsity constraints to the variational Bayesian framework of rDCM as a solution to these problems in the domain of task-based fMRI. This sparse rDCM approach enables highly efficient effective connectivity analyses in whole-brain networks and does not require a priori assumptions about the network's connectivity structure but prunes fully (all-to-all) connected networks as part of model inversion. Following the derivation of the variational Bayesian update equations for sparse rDCM, we use both simulated and empirical data to assess the face validity of the model. In particular, we show that it is feasible to infer effective connection strengths from fMRI data using a network with more than 100 regions and 10,000 connections. This demonstrates the feasibility of whole-brain inference on effective connectivity from fMRI data – in single subjects and with a run-time below 1 min when using parallelized code. We anticipate that sparse rDCM may find useful application in connectomics and clinical neuromodeling – for example, for phenotyping individual patients in terms of whole-brain network structure.},

	abstract = {In the cerebral cortex, the activity levels of neuronal populations are continuously fluctuating. When neuronal activity, as measured using functional MRI (fMRI), is temporally coherent across 2 populations, those populations are said to be functionally connected. Functional connectivity has previously been shown to correlate with structural (anatomical) connectivity patterns at an aggregate level. In the present study we investigate, with the aid of computational modeling, whether systems-level properties of functional networks--including their spatial statistics and their persistence across time--can be accounted for by properties of the underlying anatomical network. We measured resting state functional connectivity (using fMRI) and structural connectivity (using diffusion spectrum imaging tractography) in the same individuals at high resolution. Structural connectivity then provided the couplings for a model of macroscopic cortical dynamics. In both model and data, we observed (i) that strong functional connections commonly exist between regions with no direct structural connection, rendering the inference of structural connectivity from functional connectivity impractical; (ii) that indirect connections and interregional distance accounted for some of the variance in functional connectivity that was unexplained by direct structural connectivity; and (iii) that resting-state functional connectivity exhibits variability within and across both scanning sessions and model runs. These empirical and modeling results demonstrate that although resting state functional connectivity is variable and is frequently present between regions without direct structural linkage, its strength, persistence, and spatial statistics are nevertheless constrained by the large-scale anatomical structure of the human cerebral cortex.},

Therefore, statistical dependencies between functional signals in directly connected areas can be expected higher. However, the degree to which brain function is bound by the underlying wiring diagram remains a complex question that has been only partially answered. Here, we introduce the structural-decoupling index to quantify the coupling strength between structure and function, and we reveal a macroscale gradient from brain regions more strongly coupled, to regions more strongly decoupled, than expected by realistic surrogate data. This gradient spans behavioral domains from lower-level sensory function to high-level cognitive ones and shows for the first time that the strength of structure-function coupling is spatially varying in line with evidence derived from other modalities, such as functional connectivity, gene expression, microstructural properties and temporal hierarchy.},

We employed resting-state functional MRI and graph-theory approaches to systematically chart the lifespan trajectory of the topological organization of human whole-brain functional networks in 126 healthy individuals ranging in age from 7 to 85 years. Brain networks were constructed by computing Pearson's correlations in blood-oxygenation-level-dependent temporal fluctuations among 1024 parcellation units followed by graph-based network analyses. We observed that the human brain functional connectome exhibited highly preserved non-random modular and rich club organization over the entire age range studied. Further quantitative analyses revealed linear decreases in modularity and inverted-U shaped trajectories of local efficiency and rich club architecture. Regionally heterogeneous age effects were mainly located in several hubs (e.g., default network, dorsal attention regions). Finally, we observed inverse trajectories of long- and short-distance functional connections, indicating that the reorganization of connectivity concentrates and distributes the brain's functional networks. Our results demonstrate topological changes in the whole-brain functional connectome across nearly the entire human lifespan, providing insights into the neural substrates underlying individual variations in behavior and cognition. These results have important implications for disease connectomics because they provide a baseline for evaluating network impairments in age-related neuropsychiatric disorders.},

This review focuses on studies using graph theoretical measures applied to structural MRI, diffusion MRI, functional MRI, electroencephalography, and magnetoencephalography data.
RECENT FINDINGS: Complex network properties have been identified with some consistency in all modalities of neuroimaging data and over a range of spatial and time scales. Conserved properties include small worldness, high efficiency of information transfer for low wiring cost, modularity, and the existence of network hubs. Structural and functional network metrics have been found to be heritable and to change with normal aging. Clinical studies, principally in Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia, have identified abnormalities of network configuration in patients. Future work will likely involve efforts to synthesize structural and functional networks in integrated models and to explore the interdependence of network configuration and cognitive performance.
SUMMARY: Graph theoretical analysis of neuroimaging data is growing rapidly and could potentially provide a relatively simple but powerful quantitative framework to describe and compare whole human brain structural and functional networks under diverse experimental and clinical conditions.},

	abstract = {The relationship between anatomic connectivity of large-scale brain networks and their functional connectivity is of immense importance and an area of active research. Previous attempts have required complex simulations which model the dynamics of each cortical region, and explore the coupling between regions as derived by anatomic connections. While much insight is gained from these non-linear simulations, they can be computationally taxing tools for predicting functional from anatomic connectivities. Little attention has been paid to linear models. Here we show that a properly designed linear model appears to be superior to previous non-linear approaches in capturing the brain's long-range second order correlation structure that governs the relationship between anatomic and functional connectivities. We derive a linear network of brain dynamics based on graph diffusion, whereby the diffusing quantity undergoes a random walk on a graph. We test our model using subjects who underwent diffusion {MRI} and resting state {fMRI}. The network diffusion model applied to the structural networks largely predicts the correlation structures derived from their {fMRI} data, to a greater extent than other approaches. The utility of the proposed approach is that it can routinely be used to infer functional correlation from anatomic connectivity. And since it is linear, anatomic connectivity can also be inferred from functional data. The success of our model confirms the linearity of ensemble average signals in the brain, and implies that their long-range correlation structure may percolate within the brain via purely mechanistic processes enacted on its structural connectivity pathways. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Many complex networks have a small-world topology characterized by dense local clustering or cliquishness of connections between neighboring nodes yet a short path length between any (distant) pair of nodes due to the existence of relatively few long-range connections. This is an attractive model for the organization of brain anatomical and functional networks because a small-world topology can support both segregated/specialized and distributed/integrated information processing. Moreover, small-world networks are economical, tending to minimize wiring costs while supporting high dynamical complexity. The authors introduce some of the key mathematical concepts in graph theory required for small-world analysis and review how these methods have been applied to quantification of cortical connectivity matrices derived from anatomical tract-tracing studies in the macaque monkey and the cat. The evolution of small-world networks is discussed in terms of a selection pressure to deliver cost-effective information-processing systems. The authors illustrate how these techniques and concepts are increasingly being applied to the analysis of human brain functional networks derived from electroencephalography/magnetoencephalography and {fMRI} experiments. Finally, the authors consider the relevance of small-world models for understanding the emergence of complex behaviors and the resilience of brain systems to pathological attack by disease or aberrant development. They conclude that small-world models provide a powerful and versatile approach to understanding the structure and function of human brain systems.},

	abstract = {Recent research on Alzheimer's disease ({AD}) has shown that cognitive and memory decline in this disease is accompanied by disrupted changes in the coordination of large-scale brain functional networks. However, alterations in coordinated patterns of structural brain networks in {AD} are still poorly understood. Here, we used cortical thickness measurement from magnetic resonance imaging to investigate large-scale structural brain networks in 92 {AD} patients and 97 normal controls. Brain networks were constructed by thresholding cortical thickness correlation matrices of 54 regions and analyzed using graph theoretical approaches. Compared with controls, {AD} patients showed decreased cortical thickness intercorrelations between the bilateral parietal regions and increased intercorrelations in several selective regions involving the lateral temporal and parietal cortex as well as the cingulate and medial frontal cortex regions. Specially, {AD} patients showed abnormal small-world architecture in the structural cortical networks (increased clustering and shortest paths linking individual regions), implying a less optimal topological organization in {AD}. Moreover, {AD} patients were associated with reduced nodal centrality predominantly in the temporal and parietal heteromodal association cortex regions and increased nodal centrality in the occipital cortex regions. Finally, the brain networks of {AD} were about equally as robust to random failures as those of controls, but more vulnerable against targeted attacks, presumably because of the effects of pathological topological organization. Our findings suggest that the coordinated patterns of cortical morphology are widely altered in {AD} patients, thus providing structural evidence for disrupted integrity in large-scale brain networks that underlie cognition. This work has implications for our understanding of how functional deficits in patients are associated with their underlying structural (morphological) basis.},

	abstract = {Experimental evidence suggests that the maintenance of an item in working memory is achieved through persistent activity in selective neural assemblies of the cortex. To understand the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, it is essential to investigate how persistent activity is affected by external inputs or neuromodulation. We have addressed these questions using a recurrent network model of object working memory. Recurrence is dominated by inhibition, although persistent activity is generated through recurrent excitation in small subsets of excitatory neurons. Our main findings are as follows. (1) Because of the strong feedback inhibition, persistent activity shows an inverted U shape as a function of increased external drive to the network. (2) A transient external excitation can switch off a network from a selective persistent state to its spontaneous state. (3) The maintenance of the sample stimulus in working memory is not affected by intervening stimuli (distractors) during the delay period, provided the stimulation intensity is not large. On the other hand, if stimulation intensity is large enough, distractors disrupt sample-related persistent activity, and the network is able to maintain a memory only of the last shown stimulus. (4) A concerted modulation of {GABA} A and {NMDA} conductances leads to a decrease of spontaneous activity but an increase of persistent activity; the enhanced signal-to-noise ratio is shown to increase the resistance of the network to distractors. (5) Two mechanisms are identified that produce an inverted U shaped dependence of persistent activity on modulation. The present study therefore points to several mechanisms that enhance the signal-to-noise ratio in working memory states. These mechanisms could be implemented in the prefrontal cortex by dopaminergic projections from the midbrain.},

The network can switch between these states, provided the external frequency, or the balance between excitation and inhibition, is varied. Two types of network oscillations are observed. In the fast oscillatory state, the network frequency is almost fully controlled by the synaptic time scale.

At early stages of {AD} progression, prominent atrophy and metabolic abnormalities emerged in these posterior cortical regions; atrophy in medial temporal regions was also observed. Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging studies further revealed that these cortical regions are active during successful memory retrieval in young adults.

In particular, spontaneous or resting state activity has been studied on various scales of spatial and temporal organization including those that relate to physiological, encephalographic and hemodynamic data. In this article we focus on the brain from the perspective of a dynamic network and discuss the role of its network constituents in shaping brain dynamics. These constituents include the brain’s structural connectivity, the population dynamics of its network nodes and the time delays involved in signal transmission. In addition, no discussion of brain dynamics would be complete without considering noise and stochastic effects. In fact, there is mounting evidence that the interaction between noise and dynamics plays an important functional role in shaping key brain processes. In particular, we discuss a unifying theoretical framework that explains how structured spatio-temporal resting state patterns emerge from noise driven explorations of unstable or stable oscillatory states. Embracing this perspective, we explore the consequences of network manipulations to understand some of the brain’s dysfunctions, as well as network effects that offer new insights into routes towards therapy, recovery and brain repair. These collective insights will be at the core of a new computational environment, the Virtual Brain, which will allow flexible incorporation of empirical data constraining the brain models to integrate, unify and predict network responses to incipient pathological processes.},

We depart from equivalent current dipole formulations of {DCM}, and extend it to provide spatiotemporal source estimates that are spatially distributed. The spatial model is based upon neural-field equations that model neuronal activity on the cortical manifold. We approximate this description of electrocortical activity with a set of local standing-waves that are coupled though their temporal dynamics. The ensuing distributed {DCM} models source as a mixture of overlapping patches on the cortical mesh. Time-varying activity in this mixture, caused by activity in other sources and exogenous inputs, is propagated through appropriate lead-field or gain-matrices to generate observed sensor data. This spatial model has three key advantages. First, it is more appropriate than equivalent current dipole models, when real source activity is distributed locally within a cortical area. Second, the spatial degrees of freedom of the model can be specified and therefore optimised using model selection. Finally, the model is linear in the spatial parameters, which finesses model inversion. Here, we describe the distributed spatial model and present a comparative evaluation with conventional equivalent current dipole ({ECD}) models of auditory processing, as measured with {EEG}. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

This {DCM} is based upon a deterministic model that generates predicted crossed spectra from a biophysically plausible model of coupled neuronal fluctuations in a distributed neuronal network or graph. Effectively, the resulting scheme finds the best effective connectivity among hidden neuronal states that explains the observed functional connectivity among haemodynamic responses. This is because the cross spectra contain all the information about (second order) statistical dependencies among regional dynamics. In this note, we focus on describing the model, its relationship to existing measures of directed and undirected functional connectivity and establishing its face validity using simulations. In subsequent papers, we will evaluate its construct validity in relation to stochastic {DCM} and its predictive validity in Parkinson's and Huntington's disease. © 2013 The Authors.},

	abstract = {The development of large-scale network models that infer the effective (directed) connectivity among neuronal populations from neuroimaging data represents a key challenge for computational neuroscience. Dynamic causal models ({DCMs}) of neuroimaging and electrophysiological data are frequently used for inferring effective connectivity but are presently restricted to small graphs (typically up to 10 regions) in order to keep model inversion computationally feasible. Here, we present a novel variant of {DCM} for functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) data that is suited to assess effective connectivity in large (whole-brain) networks. The approach rests on translating a linear {DCM} into the frequency domain and reformulating it as a special case of Bayesian linear regression. This paper derives regression {DCM} ({rDCM}) in detail and presents a variational Bayesian inversion method that enables extremely fast inference and accelerates model inversion by several orders of magnitude compared to classical {DCM}. Using both simulated and empirical data, we demonstrate the face validity of {rDCM} under different settings of signal-to-noise ratio ({SNR}) and repetition time ({TR}) of {fMRI} data. In particular, we assess the potential utility of {rDCM} as a tool for whole-brain connectomics by challenging it to infer effective connection strengths in a simulated whole-brain network comprising 66 regions and 300 free parameters. Our results indicate that {rDCM} represents a computationally highly efficient approach with promising potential for inferring whole-brain connectivity from individual {fMRI} data.},

	abstract = {Both spontaneous and evoked potentials measured on the surface of the head are believed due to postsynaptic potentials in vertically oriented neurons in the cortex. Potential differences between surface locations at any given time are due to the instantaneous difference in synaptic activity between the corresponding vertical regions. Because of the high correlation of activity between regions separated by distances large compared to the radius of influence of single neurons, communication between these locations must be by means of action potentials. In order to quantify the dynamics of interaction of 1010cortical neurons, use is made of the concept of a neural mass. The neural mass consists of sufficiently large number of neurons so as to exhibit certain average properties which are independent of its exact inner circuitry. An integral wave equation is derived to describe the spatial-temporal variation of cortical potential. Solutions are obtained indicating that electrical oscillations, which are independent of the location and time history of subcortical input, can persist in the cortex. The nature of these oscillations depends on the relative abundance of excitatory and inhibitory connections between neural masses and on the physiological state of the brain. The latter is partially determined by velocity distribution functions for action potential propagation. A dispersion relation for brain waves is shown to exist for certain ranges of the connection parameters. In some limiting cases, weakly damped waves occur with ω=ck, where c refers to a characteristic velocity for the distribution functions. Preliminary experiments indicate qualitative agreement with this result. © 1974.},

This is achieved by reformulating the original set of integral equations as a continuous-discrete state space model. The local linearization approach is then used to discretize the state equation and to construct a nonlinear Kalman filter. On this basis, a maximum likelihood procedure is used for estimating the model parameters for several {EEG} recordings. The analysis of the noise-free differential equations of the estimated models suggests that there are two different types of alpha rhythms: those with a point attractor and others with a limit cycle attractor. These attractors are also found by means of a nonlinear time series analysis of the {EEG} recordings. We conclude that the Hopf bifurcation described by Zetterberg et al.

Neural mass models absorb implicitly a variety of properties in their constant parameters to achieve a reduction in complexity. In situations, where the local network connectivity undergoes major changes, such as in development or epilepsy, it becomes crucial to model local connectivity explicitly. This leads naturally to a description of neural fields on folded cortical sheets with local and global connectivities. The numerical approximation of neural fields in biologically realistic situations as addressed in Virtual Brain simulations (see http://thevirtualbrain.org/app/ (version 1.0)) is challenging and requires a thorough evaluation if the Virtual Brain approach is to be adapted for systematic studies of disease and disorders. Here we analyze the sampling problem of neural fields for arbitrary dimensions and provide explicit results for one, two and three dimensions relevant to realistically folded cortical surfaces. We characterize (i) the error due to sampling of spatial distribution functions; (ii) useful sampling parameter ranges in the context of encephalographic ({EEG}, {MEG}, {ECoG} and functional {MRI}) signals; (iii) guidelines for choosing the right spatial distribution function for given anatomical and geometrical constraints. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

This macroscopic field theory is derived from the quasi-microscopic conversion properties of neural populations occurring at synapses and somas. The quasi-microscopic models by Wilson-Cowan (1972,1973) and Nunez (1974) can be derived from these. Functional units are treated as inhomogeneities within a nonlinear one-dimensional neural tissue. Second, for the case of the Kelso experiment the field equation is treated analytically and numerically and can be reduced to a set of ordinary differential equations which corresponds to a model by Jirsa et al. (1994, 1995). This phenomenological model reproduces the spatio-temporal phenomena experimentally observed. Here the most prominent property of the neural tissue is the parametric excitation. The macroscopic field parameters can be expressed by quasi-microscopic neural parameters.},

The eigenmodes of a single brain hemisphere are found to be close analogs of spherical harmonics, which are the natural modes of the sphere. Instead of multiple eigenvalues being equal, as in the spherical case, cortical folding splits them to have distinct values. Inclusion of interhemispheric connections between homologous regions via the corpus callosum leads to further splitting that depends on symmetry or antisymmetry of activity between brain hemispheres, and the strength and sign of the interhemispheric connections. Symmetry properties of the lowest observed eigenmodes strongly constrain the interhemispheric connectivity strengths and unihemispheric mode spectra, and it is predicted that most spontaneous brain activity will be symmetric between hemispheres, consistent with observations. Comparison with the eigenmodes of an experimental anatomical connectivity matrix confirms these results, permits the relative strengths of intrahemispheric and interhemispheric connectivities to be approximately inferred from their eigenvalues, and lays the foundation for further experimental tests. The results are consistent with brain activity being in corticothalamic eigenmodes, rather than discrete “networks” and open the way to new approaches to brain analysis.},

On each scale, from gene, protein, synapse, neuron and microcircuit, to area, pathway and the whole brain, many advances have been made with the development of related techniques. Brain network studies on different temporal and spatial scales are booming. However, such studies have focused on single levels, and can only reflect limited aspects of how the brain is formed and how it works. Therefore, it is increasingly urgent to integrate a variety of techniques, methods and models, and to merge fragmented findings into a uniform research framework or platform. To this end, we have proposed the concept of the brainnetome and several related programs/projects have been launched in China. In this paper, we offer a brief review on the methodologies of the brainnetome, which include techniques on different scales, the brainnetome atlas, and methods of brain network analysis. We then take Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia as examples to show how the brainnetome can be studied in neurological and psychiatric disorders. We also review the studies of how risk genes for brain diseases affect the brain networks. Finally, we summarize the challenges for the brainnetome, and what actions and measures have been taken to address these challenges in China. It is envisioned that the brainnetome will open new avenues and some long-standing issues may be solved by combining the brainnetome with other "omes".},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Patients with temporal lobe epilepsy ({TLE}) with hippocampal sclerosis ({HS}) have diffuse subtle gray matter ({GM}) atrophy detectable by {MRI} quantification analyses. However, it is not clear whether the etiology and seizure frequency are associated with this atrophy. We aimed to evaluate the occurrence of {GM} atrophy and the influence of seizure frequency in patients with {TLE} and either normal {MRI} ({TLE}-{NL}) or {MRI} signs of {HS} ({TLE}-{HS}).
{METHODS}: We evaluated a group of 172 consecutive patients with unilateral {TLE}-{HS} or {TLE}-{NL} as defined by hippocampal volumetry and signal quantification (122 {TLE}-{HS} and 50 {TLE}-{NL}) plus a group of 82 healthy individuals. Voxel-based morphometry was performed with {VBM}8/{SPM}8 in 3T {MRIs}. Patients with up to three complex partial seizures and no generalized tonic-clonic seizures in the previous year were considered to have infrequent seizures. Those who did not fulfill these criteria were considered to have frequent seizures.
{RESULTS}: Patients with {TLE}-{HS} had more pronounced {GM} atrophy, including the ipsilateral mesial temporal structures, temporal lobe, bilateral thalami and pre/post-central gyri. Patients with {TLE}-{NL} had more subtle {GM} atrophy, including the ipsilateral orbitofrontal cortex, bilateral thalami and pre/post-central gyri. Both {TLE}-{HS} and {TLE}-{NL} showed increased {GM} volume in the contralateral pons. {TLE}-{HS} patients with frequent seizures had more pronounced {GM} atrophy in extra-temporal regions than {TLE}-{HS} with infrequent seizures. Patients with {TLE}-{NL} and infrequent seizures had no detectable {GM} atrophy. In both {TLE}-{HS} and {TLE}-{NL}, the duration of epilepsy correlated with {GM} atrophy in extra-hippocampal regions.
{CONCLUSION}: Although a diffuse network {GM} atrophy occurs in both {TLE}-{HS} and {TLE}-{NL}, this is strikingly more evident in {TLE}-{HS} and in patients with frequent seizures. These findings suggest that neocortical atrophy in {TLE} is related to the ongoing seizures and epilepsy duration, while thalamic atrophy is more probably related to the original epileptogenic process.},

	abstract = {Stroke causes a sudden disruption of physiological brain function which leads to impairments of functional brain networks involved in voluntary movements. In some cases, the brain has the intrinsic capacity to reorganize itself, thereby compensating for the disruption of motor networks. In humans, such reorganization can be investigated in vivo using neuroimaging. Recent developments in connectivity analyses based on functional neuroimaging data have provided new insights into the network pathophysiology underlying neurological symptoms. Here we review recent neuroimaging studies using functional resting-state correlations, effective connectivity models or graph theoretical analyses to investigate changes in neural motor networks and recovery after stroke. The data demonstrate that network disturbances after stroke occur not only in the vicinity of the lesion but also between remote cortical areas in the affected and unaffected hemisphere. The reorganization of motor networks encompasses a restoration of interhemispheric functional coherence in the resting state, particularly between the primary motor cortices. Furthermore, reorganized neural networks feature strong excitatory interactions between fronto-parietal areas and primary motor cortex in the affected hemisphere, suggesting that greater top-down control over primary motor areas facilitates motor execution in the lesioned brain. In addition, there is evidence that motor recovery is accompanied by a more random network topology with reduced local information processing. In conclusion, Stroke induces changes in functional and effective connectivity within and across hemispheres which relate to motor impairments and recovery thereof. Connectivity analyses may hence provide new insights into the pathophysiology underlying neurological deficits and may be further used to develop novel, neurobiologically informed treatment strategies.},

	abstract = {In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the study of large-scale brain activity interaction structure from the perspective of complex networks, based on functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) measurements. To assess the strength of interaction (functional connectivity, {FC}) between two brain regions, the linear (Pearson) correlation coefficient of the respective time series is most commonly used. Since a potential use of nonlinear {FC} measures has recently been discussed in this and other fields, the question arises whether particular nonlinear {FC} measures would be more informative for the graph analysis than linear ones. We present a comparison of network analysis results obtained from the brain connectivity graphs capturing either full (both linear and nonlinear) or only linear connectivity using 24 sessions of human resting-state {fMRI}. For each session, a matrix of full connectivity between 90 anatomical parcel time series is computed using mutual information. For comparison, connectivity matrices obtained for multivariate linear Gaussian surrogate data that preserve the correlations, but remove any nonlinearity are generated. Binarizing these matrices using multiple thresholds, we generate graphs corresponding to linear and full nonlinear interaction structures. The effect of neglecting nonlinearity is then assessed by comparing the values of a range of graph-theoretical measures evaluated for both types of graphs. Statistical comparisons suggest a potential effect of nonlinearity on the local measures-clustering coefficient and betweenness centrality. Nevertheless, subsequent quantitative comparison shows that the nonlinearity effect is practically negligible when compared to the intersubject variability of the graph measures. Further, on the group-average graph level, the nonlinearity effect is unnoticeable.},

	abstract = {Functional connectivity ({FC}) analysis is a prominent approach to analyzing {fMRI} data, especially acquired under the resting state condition. The commonly used linear correlation {FC} measure bears an implicit assumption of Gaussianity of the dependence structure. If only the marginals, but not all the bivariate distributions are Gaussian, linear correlation consistently underestimates the strength of the dependence. To assess the suitability of linear correlation and the general potential of nonlinear {FC} measures, we present a framework for testing and estimating the deviation from Gaussianity by means of comparing mutual information in the data and its Gaussianized counterpart. We apply this method to 24 sessions of human resting state {fMRI}. For each session, matrix of connectivities between 90 anatomical parcel time series is computed using mutual information and compared to results from its multivariate Gaussian surrogate that conserves the correlations but cancels any nonlinearity. While the group-level tests confirmed non-Gaussianity in the {FC}, the quantitative assessment revealed that the portion of mutual information neglected by linear correlation is relatively minor-on average only about 5\% of the mutual information already captured by the linear correlation. The marginality of the non-Gaussianity was confirmed in comparisons using clustering of the parcels-the disagreement between clustering obtained from mutual information and linear correlation was attributable to random error. We conclude that for this type of data, practical relevance of nonlinear methods trying to improve over linear correlation might be limited by the fact that the data are indeed almost Gaussian.},

Therefore, the ongoing activity ascribed to the different functional brain networks should also be able to reorganise and coordinate via similar mechanisms. We develop a novel method for identifying large-scale phase-coupled network dynamics and show that resting networks in magnetoencephalography are well characterised by visits to short-lived transient brain states, with spatially distinct patterns of oscillatory power and coherence in specific frequency bands. Brain states are identified for sensory, motor networks and higher-order cognitive networks. The cognitive networks include a posterior alpha (8–12 Hz) and an anterior delta/theta range (1–7 Hz) network, both exhibiting high power and coherence in areas that correspond to posterior and anterior subdivisions of the default mode network. Our results show that large-scale cortical phase-coupling networks have characteristic signatures in very specific frequency bands, possibly reflecting functional specialisation at different intrinsic timescales.},

	abstract = {A growing body of neuroimaging research has documented that, in the absence of an explicit task, the brain shows temporally coherent activity. This so-called "resting state" activity or, more explicitly, the default-mode network, has been associated with daydreaming, free association, stream of consciousness, or inner rehearsal in humans, but similar patterns have also been found under anesthesia and in monkeys. Spatiotemporal activity patterns in the default-mode network are both complex and consistent, which raises the question whether they are the expression of an interesting cognitive architecture or the consequence of intrinsic network constraints. In numerical simulation, we studied the dynamics of a simplified cortical network using 38 noise-driven (Wilson-Cowan) oscillators, which in isolation remain just below their oscillatory threshold. Time delay coupling based on lengths and strengths of primate corticocortical pathways leads to the emergence of 2 sets of 40-Hz oscillators. The sets showed synchronization that was anticorrelated at {\textless}0.1 Hz across the sets in line with a wide range of recent experimental observations. Systematic variation of conduction velocity, coupling strength, and noise level indicate a high sensitivity of emerging synchrony as well as simulated blood flow blood oxygen level-dependent ({BOLD}) on the underlying parameter values. Optimal sensitivity was observed around conduction velocities of 1-2 m/s, with very weak coupling between oscillators. An additional finding was that the optimal noise level had a characteristic scale, indicating the presence of stochastic resonance, which allows the network dynamics to respond with high sensitivity to changes in diffuse feedback activity.},

	abstract = {Traditionally brain function is studied through measuring physiological responses in controlled sensory, motor, and cognitive paradigms. However, even at rest, in the absence of overt goal-directed behavior, collections of cortical regions consistently show temporally coherent activity. In humans, these resting state networks have been shown to greatly overlap with functional architectures present during consciously directed activity, which motivates the interpretation of rest activity as day dreaming, free association, stream of consciousness, and inner rehearsal. In monkeys, it has been shown though that similar coherent fluctuations are present during deep anesthesia when there is no consciousness. Here, we show that comparable resting state networks emerge from a stability analysis of the network dynamics using biologically realistic primate brain connectivity, although anatomical information alone does not identify the network. We specifically demonstrate that noise and time delays via propagation along connecting fibres are essential for the emergence of the coherent fluctuations of the default network. The spatiotemporal network dynamics evolves on multiple temporal scales and displays the intermittent neuroelectric oscillations in the fast frequency regimes, 1-100 Hz, commonly observed in electroencephalographic and magnetoencephalographic recordings, as well as the hemodynamic oscillations in the ultraslow regimes, {\textless}0.1 Hz, observed in functional magnetic resonance imaging. The combination of anatomical structure and time delays creates a space-time structure in which the neural noise enables the brain to explore various functional configurations representing its dynamic repertoire.},

During the past decades, anatomical, neurophysiological and neuroimaging research in multimodal integration have stood out in the effort to understand the perceptual binding properties of the brain. Areas in the human lateral occipitotemporal, prefrontal, and posterior parietal cortices have been associated with sensory multimodal processing. Even though this, rather patchy, organization of brain regions gives us a glimpse of the perceptual convergence, the articulation of the flow of information from modality-related to the more parallel cognitive processing systems remains elusive. Using a method called stepwise functional connectivity analysis, the present study analyzes the functional connectome and transitions from primary sensory cortices to higher-order brain systems. We identify the large-scale multimodal integration network and essential connectivity axes for perceptual integration in the human brain.},

Previous work has described local functional gradients extending from perceptual and motor regions to cortical areas representing more abstract functions, but an overarching framework for the association between structure and function is still lacking. Here, we show that the principal gradient revealed by the decomposition of connectivity data in humans and the macaque monkey is anchored by, at one end, regions serving primary sensory/motor functions and at the other end, transmodal regions that, in humans, are known as the default-mode network ({DMN}). These {DMN} regions exhibit the greatest geodesic distance along the cortical surface—and are precisely equidistant—from primary sensory/motor morphological landmarks. The principal gradient also provides an organizing spatial framework for multiple large-scale networks and characterizes a spectrum from unimodal to heteromodal activity in a functional metaanalysis. Together, these observations provide a characterization of the topographical organization of cortex and indicate that the role of the {DMN} in cognition might arise from its position at one extreme of a hierarchy, allowing it to process transmodal information that is unrelated to immediate sensory input.},

Prescan anxiety ratings correlated with intrinsic functional connectivity of the {dACC} node of the salience network, but with no region in the executive-control network, whereas executive task performance correlated with lateral parietal nodes of the executive-control network, but with no region in the salience network.

We identify two diametrically opposed, widely distributed brain networks on the basis of both spontaneous correlations within each network and anticorrelations between networks. One network consists of regions routinely exhibiting task-related activations and the other of regions routinely exhibiting task-related deactivations. This intrinsic organization, featuring the presence of anticorrelated networks in the absence of overt task performance, provides a critical context in which to understand brain function.

	abstract = {The brain’s functional connectivity ({FC}) estimated at sensor level from electromagnetic ({EEG}/{MEG}) signals can provide quick and useful information towards understanding cognition and brain disorders. Volume conduction ({VC}) is a fundamental issue in {FC} analysis due to the effects of instantaneous correlations. {FC} methods based on the imaginary part of the coherence ({iCOH}) of any two signals are readily robust to {VC} effects, but neglecting the real part of the coherence leads to negligible {FC} when the processes are truly connected but with zero or π-phase (modulus 2π) interaction. We ameliorate this issue by proposing a novel method that implements an envelope of the imaginary coherence ({EIC}) to approximate the coherence estimate of supposedly active underlying sources. We compare {EIC} with state-of-the-art {FC} measures that included lagged coherence, {iCOH}, phase lag index ({PLI}) and weighted {PLI} ({wPLI}), using bivariate autoregressive and stochastic neural mass models. Additionally, we create realistic simulations where three and five regions were mapped on a template cortical surface and synthetic {MEG} signals were obtained after computing the electromagnetic leadfield. With this simulation and comparison study, we also demonstrate the feasibility of sensor {FC} analysis using receiver operating curve analysis whilst varying the signal’s noise level. However, these results should be interpreted with caution given the known limitations of the sensor-based {FC} approach. Overall, we found that {EIC} and {iCOH} demonstrate superior results with most accurate {FC} maps. As they complement each other in different scenarios, that will be important to study normal and diseased brain activity.},

Modelling predicts that these node length differences will alter conduction speed by {\textasciitilde}20\%, similar to the changes produced by altering the number of myelin wraps or the internode length. For a given change of conduction speed, the membrane area change needed at the node is {\textgreater}270-fold less than that needed in the myelin sheath.

Furthermore, the organizational properties of resting-state functional networks are thought to serve as the basis for an optimal cognitive integration. A disconnection at the structural level, as occurring in some brain diseases, would then lead to functional and presumably cognitive impairments. In this work, we propose a computational model to investigate the role of a structural disconnection (encompassing putative local/global and axonal/synaptic mechanisms) on the organizational properties of emergent functional networks. The brain's spontaneous neural activity and the corresponding hemodynamic response were simulated using a large-scale network model, consisting of local neural populations coupled through white matter fibers. For a certain coupling strength, simulations reproduced healthy resting-state functional connectivity with graph properties in the range of the ones reported experimentally. When the structural connectivity is decreased, either globally or locally, the resultant simulated functional connectivity exhibited a network reorganization characterized by an increase in hierarchy, efficiency and robustness, a decrease in small-worldness and clustering and a narrower degree distribution, in the same way as recently reported for schizophrenia patients. Theoretical results indicate that most disconnection-related neuropathologies should induce the same qualitative changes in resting-state brain activity.},

	abstract = {Functional networks obtained from magnetoencephalography ({MEG}) from different frequency bands show distinct spatial patterns. It remains to be elucidated how distinct spatial patterns in {MEG} networks emerge given a single underlying structural network. Recent work has suggested that the eigenmodes of the structural network might serve as a basis set for functional network patterns in the case of functional {MRI}. Here, we take this notion further in the context of frequency band specific {MEG} networks. We show that a selected set of eigenmodes of the structural network can predict different frequency band specific networks in the resting state, ranging from delta (1–4Hz) to the high gamma band (40–70Hz). These predictions outperform predictions based from surrogate data, suggesting a genuine relationship between eigenmodes of the structural network and frequency specific {MEG} networks. We then show that the relevant set of eigenmodes can be excited in a network of neural mass models using linear stability analysis only by including delays. Excitation of an eigenmode in this context refers to a dynamic instability of a network steady state to a spatial pattern with a corresponding coherent temporal oscillation. Simulations verify the results from linear stability analysis and suggest that theta, alpha and beta band networks emerge very near to the bifurcation. The delta and gamma bands in the resting state emerges further away from the bifurcation. These results show for the first time how delayed interactions can excite the relevant set of eigenmodes that give rise to frequency specific functional connectivity patterns.},

Between-group differences in connection distance were localized specifically to connector hubs of multimodal association cortex.

	abstract = {Objective
An important problem in systems neuroscience is the relation between complex structural and functional brain networks. Here we use simulations of a simple dynamic process based upon the susceptible–infected–susceptible ({SIS}) model of infection dynamics on an empirical structural brain network to investigate the extent to which the functional interactions between any two brain areas depend upon (i) the presence of a direct structural connection; and (ii) the degree product of the two areas in the structural network.
Methods
For the structural brain network, we used a 78×78 matrix representing known anatomical connections between brain regions at the level of the {AAL} atlas (Gong et al., 2009). On this structural network we simulated brain dynamics using a model derived from the study of epidemic processes on networks. Analogous to the {SIS} model, each vertex/brain region could be in one of two states (inactive/active) with two parameters β and δ determining the transition probabilities. First, the phase transition between the fully inactive and partially active state was investigated as a function of β and δ. Second, the statistical interdependencies between time series of node states were determined (close to and far away from the critical state) with two measures: (i) functional connectivity based upon the correlation coefficient of integrated activation time series; and (ii) effective connectivity based upon conditional co-activation at different time intervals.
Results
We find a phase transition between an inactive and a partially active state for a critical ratio τ=β/δ of the transition rates in agreement with the theory of {SIS} models. Slightly above the critical threshold, node activity increases with degree, also in line with epidemic theory. The functional, but not the effective connectivity matrix closely resembled the underlying structural matrix. Both functional connectivity and, to a lesser extent, effective connectivity were higher for connected as compared to disconnected (i.e.: not directly connected) nodes. Effective connectivity scaled with the degree product. For functional connectivity, a weaker scaling relation was only observed for disconnected node pairs. For random networks with the same degree distribution as the original structural network, similar patterns were seen, but the scaling exponent was significantly decreased especially for effective connectivity.
Conclusions
Even with a very simple dynamical model it can be shown that functional relations between nodes of a realistic anatomical network display clear patterns if the system is studied near the critical transition. The detailed nature of these patterns depends on the properties of the functional or effective connectivity measure that is used. While the strength of functional interactions between any two nodes clearly depends upon the presence or absence of a direct connection, this study has shown that the degree product of the nodes also plays a large role in explaining interaction strength, especially for disconnected nodes and in combination with an effective connectivity measure. The influence of degree product on node interaction strength probably reflects the presence of large numbers of indirect connections.},

Here, we apply analytic measures of network communication to the structural connectivity of the human brain and explore the capacity of these measures to predict resting-state functional connectivity across three independently acquired datasets. We focus on the layout of shortest paths across the network and on two communication measures—search information and path transitivity—which account for how these paths are embedded in the rest of the network. Search information is an existing measure of information needed to access or trace shortest paths; we introduce path transitivity to measure the density of local detours along the shortest path. We find that both search information and path transitivity predict the strength of functional connectivity among both connected and unconnected node pairs. They do so at levels that match or significantly exceed path length measures, Euclidean distance, as well as computational models of neural dynamics. This capacity suggests that dynamic couplings due to interactions among neural elements in brain networks are substantially influenced by the broader network context adjacent to the shortest communication pathways.},

Most of models have considered balanced networks of excitatory and inhibitory spiking neurons in which {AI} states are sustained through recurrent sparse connectivity, with or without external input. In this letter we propose a mesoscopic description of such {AI} states. Using master equation formalism, we derive a second-order mean-field set of ordinary differential equations describing the temporal evolution of randomly connected balanced networks. This formalism takes into account finite size effects and is applicable to any neuron model as long as its transfer function can be characterized. We compare the predictions of this approach with numerical simulations for different network configurations and parameter spaces. Considering the randomly connected network as a unit, this approach could be used to build large-scale networks of such connected units, with an aim to model activity states constrained by macroscopic measurements, such as voltage-sensitive dye imaging.},

Here, we attempt to reconcile models operating at the microscopic (compartmental) and mesoscopic (neural mass) scales to analyse data from microelectrode recordings of intralaminar neural activity. Although these two classes of models operate at different scales, it is relatively straightforward to create neural mass models of ensemble activity that are equipped with priors obtained after fitting data generated by detailed microscopic models. This provides generative (forward) models of measured neuronal responses that retain construct validity in relation to compartmental models. We illustrate our approach using cross spectral responses obtained from V1 during a visual perception paradigm that involved optogenetic manipulation of the basal forebrain. We find that the resulting neural mass model can distinguish between activity in distinct cortical layers – both with and without optogenetic activation – and that cholinergic input appears to enhance (disinhibit) superficial layer activity relative to deep layers. This is particularly interesting from the perspective of predictive coding, where neuromodulators are thought to boost prediction errors that ascend the cortical hierarchy.},

Only recently was the dynamic behaviour of {FC} revealed, showing that on top of correlational patterns of spontaneous {fMRI} signal fluctuations, connectivity between different brain regions exhibits meaningful variations within a typical resting-state {fMRI} experiment. As a consequence, a considerable amount of work has been directed to assessing and characterising dynamic {FC} ({dFC}), and several different approaches were explored to identify relevant {FC} fluctuations. At the same time, several questions were raised about the nature of {dFC}, which would be of interest only if brought back to a neural origin. In support of this, correlations with electroencephalography ({EEG}) recordings, demographic and behavioural data were established, and various clinical applications were explored, where the potential of {dFC} could be preliminarily demonstrated. In this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive description of the {dFC} approaches proposed so far, and point at the directions that we see as most promising for the future developments of the field. Advantages and pitfalls of {dFC} analyses are addressed, helping the readers to orient themselves through the complex web of available methodologies and tools.},

These changes might be explained by several factors, including intrinsic fluctuations in activity-dependent neuronal coupling and contextual factors, like experimental condition and time. Furthermore, contextual effects may be subject-specific or conserved over subjects. To characterize fluctuations in effective connectivity, we used dynamic causal modelling ({DCM}) of cross spectral responses over 1-min of electroencephalogram ({EEG}) recordings during rest, divided into 1-sec windows. We focused on two intrinsic networks: the default mode and the saliency network. {DCM} was applied to estimate connectivity in each time-window for both networks. Fluctuations in {DCM} connectivity parameters were assessed using hierarchical parametric empirical Bayes ({PEB}). Within-subject, between-window effects were modelled with a second-level linear model with temporal basis functions as regressors. This procedure was conducted for every subject separately. Bayesian model reduction was then used to assess which (combination of) temporal basis functions best explain dynamic connectivity over windows. A third (between-subject) level model was used to infer which dynamic connectivity parameters are conserved over subjects. Our results indicate that connectivity fluctuations in the default mode network and to a lesser extent the saliency network comprised both subject-specific components and a common component. For both networks, connections to higher order regions appear to monotonically increase during the 1-min period. These results not only establish the predictive validity of dynamic connectivity estimates – in virtue of detecting systematic changes over subjects – they also suggest a network-specific dissociation in the relative contribution of fluctuations in connectivity that depend upon experimental context. We envisage these procedures could be useful for characterizing brain state transitions that may be explained by their cognitive or neuropathological underpinnings.},

	abstract = {Although {MEG}/{EEG} signals are highly variable, systematic changes in distinct frequency bands are commonly encountered. These frequency-specific changes represent robust neural correlates of cognitive or perceptual processes (for example, alpha rhythms emerge on closing the eyes). However, their functional significance remains a matter of debate. Some of the mechanisms that generate these signals are known at the cellular level and rest on a balance of excitatory and inhibitory interactions within and between populations of neurons. The kinetics of the ensuing population dynamics determine the frequency of oscillations. In this work we extended the classical nonlinear lumped-parameter model of alpha rhythms, initially developed by Lopes da Silva and colleagues [Kybernetik 15 (1974) 27], to generate more complex dynamics. We show that the whole spectrum of {MEG}/{EEG} signals can be reproduced within the oscillatory regime of this model by simply changing the population kinetics. We used the model to examine the influence of coupling strength and propagation delay on the rhythms generated by coupled cortical areas. The main findings were that (1) coupling induces phase-locked activity, with a phase shift of 0 or ?? when the coupling is bidirectional, and (2) both coupling and propagation delay are critical determinants of the {MEG}/{EEG} spectrum. In forthcoming articles, we will use this model to (1) estimate how neuronal interactions are expressed in {MEG}/{EEG} oscillations and establish the construct validity of various indices of nonlinear coupling, and (2) generate event-related transients to derive physiologically informed basis functions for statistical modelling of average evoked responses. ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc.

I hypothesize that neuronal communication is mechanistically subserved by neuronal coherence. Activated neuronal groups oscillate and thereby undergo rhythmic excitability fluctuations that produce temporal windows for communication. Only coherently oscillating neuronal groups can interact effectively, because their communication windows for input and for output are open at the same times.

	abstract = {The remarkable processing capabilities of the brain rely on efficient communication between the huge number of neurons and neuronal assemblies that constitute functionally specialized units. Abundant anatomical connections form the structural basis of communication. Functionally, the synchronization of oscillatory neuronal activity has increasingly been recognized as a mechanism for long-range communication.Studies of the insect olfactory system provide the most direct evidence that oscillatory communication is behaviourally relevant. These and other studies point towards several mechanisms that funtion on different spatial scales to support interneuronal communication. Filtering and resonance phenomena indicate the dependence of neuronal activity on the frequency content of the input. Specific structural connectivity underlies the emergence of particular network properties that facilitate specific computations by spatiotemporal patterns of excitation and inhibition.New analytical methods have allowed the non-invasive investigation of frequency-specific long-range communication in the human brain with magnetoencephalographic ({MEG}) recordings.Recent studies in humans and monkeys have provided new evidence for the physiological relevance of oscillatory synchronization in motor and cognitive functions. Synchronization in the beta frequency band seems to have a particularly important role in long-range communication. The functional relevance of desynchronization processes is also being increasingly recognized, and specific spatiotemporal patterns of synchronization desynchronization have been directly related to attentional processes and behavioural performance.In the human motor system, oscillations in the primary motor cortex modulate the firing rate of spinal motor neurons. This modulation is evident as oscillatory coupling between motor cortex activity and muscle activity.Electrophysiological recordings of basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits in healthy monkeys, a monkey model of Parkinson's disease and patients with Parkinson's disease have provided new insights into the functional roles of oscillations and oscillatory synchronization in normal and disturbed motor behaviour. Specifically, enhanced beta and reduced gamma oscillations are associated with the poverty and slowness of movement that is characteristic of Parkinson's disease. In addition, tremor seems to arise from abnormal synchronization of oscillations in several cortical and subcortical brain areas.Chronic high-frequency deep brain stimulation, which can be delivered through electrodes that have been implanted in specific basal ganglia target structures, greatly improves motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease, probably through desynchronizing effects.Pathological changes in long-range synchronization are also evident in other movement disorders, as well as in neuropsychiatric diseases. Further work is needed to better understand the mechanisms that govern oscillatory communication and the consequences of disturbed communication. Hopefully, these studies will lead to the development of new therapeutic approaches.},

	abstract = {The large-scale integration problem refers to the series of processes whereby the nervous system coordinates activity that is distributed over distant brain regions to produce a unified cognitive moment. One of the most plausible candidate mechanisms behind large-scale integration is the formation of dynamic links among brain regions, links that are mediated by phase synchronization. Phase synchronization refers to the relation between the temporal structures of the neural signals regardless of signal amplitude. Two signals are said to be synchronous if their rhythms coincide. Neural assemblies — distributed networks of neurons linked by reciprocal connections — provide a conceptual framework for the integration of distributed neural activity. Large-scale integration commonly involves neural assemblies separated by long distances. Converging evidence indicates that phase synchrony is probably involved in brain integration. Electrophysiological analyses in cats and primates have shown that the emergence of phase synchrony over widespread cortical domain correlates with the occurrence of attentive and perceptuomotor behaviours, as well as during the execution of a learning task. Analogous findings have been made in humans using electroencephalographic and magnetoencephalographic techniques. Although the evidence for phase synchronization as a mechanism for large-scale integration is well grounded, it is only correlative. Direct proof that changes in synchronous activity can affect behaviour remains to be established in most cases. Similarly, the cellular mechanisms of synchronization, the interplay between slow and fast brain rhythms, and the role of parallel phase synchronization over different frequency bands constitute topics for future research.},

	abstract = {Neuronal dynamics unfolding within the cerebral cortex exhibit complex spatial and temporal patterns even in the absence of external input. Here we use a computational approach in an attempt to relate these features of spontaneous cortical dynamics to the underlying anatomical connectivity. Simulating nonlinear neuronal dynamics on a network that captures the large-scale interregional connections of macaque neocortex, and applying information theoretic measures to identify functional networks, we find structure-function relations at multiple temporal scales. Functional networks recovered from long windows of neural activity (minutes) largely overlap with the underlying structural network. As a result, hubs in these long-run functional networks correspond to structural hubs. In contrast, significant fluctuations in functional topology are observed across the sequence of networks recovered from consecutive shorter (seconds) time windows. The functional centrality of individual nodes varies across time as interregional couplings shift. Furthermore, the transient couplings between brain regions are coordinated in a manner that reveals the existence of two anticorrelated clusters. These clusters are linked by prefrontal and parietal regions that are hub nodes in the underlying structural network. At an even faster time scale (hundreds of milliseconds) we detect individual episodes of interregional phase-locking and find that slow variations in the statistics of these transient episodes, contingent on the underlying anatomical structure, produce the transfer entropy functional connectivity and simulated blood oxygenation level-dependent correlation patterns observed on slower time scales.},

	abstract = {Recently, there has been a lot of interest in characterising the connectivity of resting state brain networks. Most of the literature uses functional connectivity to examine these intrinsic brain networks. Functional connectivity has well documented limitations because of its inherent inability to identify causal interactions. Dynamic causal modelling ({DCM}) is a framework that allows for the identification of the causal (directed) connections among neuronal systems - known as effective connectivity. This technical note addresses the validity of a recently proposed {DCM} for resting state {fMRI} - as measured in terms of their complex cross spectral density - referred to as spectral {DCM}. Spectral {DCM} differs from (the alternative) stochastic {DCM} by parameterising neuronal fluctuations using scale free (i.e., power law) forms, rendering the stochastic model of neuronal activity deterministic. Spectral {DCM} not only furnishes an efficient estimation of model parameters but also enables the detection of group differences in effective connectivity, the form and amplitude of the neuronal fluctuations or both. We compare and contrast spectral and stochastic {DCM} models with endogenous fluctuations or state noise on hidden states. We used simulated data to first establish the face validity of both schemes and show that they can recover the model (and its parameters) that generated the data. We then used Monte Carlo simulations to assess the accuracy of both schemes in terms of their root mean square error. We also simulated group differences and compared the ability of spectral and stochastic {DCMs} to identify these differences. We show that spectral {DCM} was not only more accurate but also more sensitive to group differences. Finally, we performed a comparative evaluation using real resting state {fMRI} data (from an open access resource) to study the functional integration within default mode network using spectral and stochastic {DCMs}.},

	abstract = {Context-sensitive and activity-dependent fluctuations in connectivity underlie functional integration in the brain and have been studied widely in terms of synaptic plasticity, learning and condition-specific (e.g., attentional) modulations of synaptic efficacy. This dynamic aspect of brain connectivity has recently attracted a lot of attention in the resting state {fMRI} community. To explain dynamic functional connectivity in terms of directed effective connectivity among brain regions, we introduce a novel method to identify dynamic effective connectivity using spectral dynamic causal modelling ({spDCM}). We used parametric empirical Bayes ({PEB}) to model fluctuations in directed coupling over consecutive windows of resting state {fMRI} time series. Hierarchical {PEB} can model random effects on connectivity parameters at the second (between-window) level given connectivity estimates from the first (within-window) level. In this work, we used a discrete cosine transform basis set or eigenvariates (i.e., expression of principal components) to model fluctuations in effective connectivity over windows. We evaluated the ensuing dynamic effective connectivity in terms of the consistency of baseline connectivity within default mode network ({DMN}), using the resting state {fMRI} from Human Connectome Project ({HCP}). To model group-level baseline and dynamic effective connectivity for {DMN}, we extended the {PEB} approach by conducting a multilevel {PEB} analysis of between-session and between-subject group effects. Model comparison clearly spoke to dynamic fluctuations in effective connectivity – and the dynamic functional connectivity these changes explain. Furthermore, baseline effective connectivity was consistent across independent sessions – and notably more consistent than estimates based upon conventional models. This work illustrates the advantage of hierarchical modelling with {spDCM}, in characterizing the dynamics of effective connectivity.},

	abstract = {The white matter architecture of brain networks promotes synchrony among neuronal populations, giving rise to richly patterned functional networks. Relating structure and function is a fundamental question for systems neuroscience, but the nature of the relationship is unknown. Here we examine the possibility that structure–function relationships are not uniform in the brain. We find that structure and function are closely aligned in unimodal cortex (primary sensory and motor regions), but diverge in transmodal cortex (default mode and salience networks). The divergence between structure and function closely follows representational and cytoarchitectonic hierarchies, reflecting a macroscale gradient. Our findings suggest structure and function are not uniformly related, but gradually decouple in parallel to this macroscale gradient.

The white matter architecture of the brain imparts a distinct signature on neuronal coactivation patterns. Interregional projections promote synchrony among distant neuronal populations, giving rise to richly patterned functional networks. A variety of statistical, communication, and biophysical models have been proposed to study the relationship between brain structure and function, but the link is not yet known. In the present report we seek to relate the structural and functional connection profiles of individual brain areas. We apply a simple multilinear model that incorporates information about spatial proximity, routing, and diffusion between brain regions to predict their functional connectivity. We find that structure–function relationships vary markedly across the neocortex. Structure and function correspond closely in unimodal, primary sensory, and motor regions, but diverge in transmodal cortex, particularly the default mode and salience networks. The divergence between structure and function systematically follows functional and cytoarchitectonic hierarchies. Altogether, the present results demonstrate that structural and functional networks do not align uniformly across the brain, but gradually uncouple in higher-order polysensory areas.},

One network, often called the default network, is positioned at the apex of a gradient of sequential networks that radiate outward from primary cortex. Here, extensive anatomical data made available through the Marmoset Brain Architecture Project are explored to show a homologue exists in marmoset. Results reveal that a gradient of networks extend outward from primary cortex to progressively higher-order transmodal association cortex in both frontal and temporal cortex. The apex transmodal network comprises frontopolar and rostral temporal association cortex, parahippocampal areas {TH} / {TF}, the ventral posterior midline, and lateral parietal association cortex. The positioning of this network in the gradient and its composition of areas make it a candidate homologue to the human default network. That the marmoset, a physiologically- and genetically-accessible primate, might possess a default-network-like candidate creates opportunities for study of higher cognitive and social functions.},
